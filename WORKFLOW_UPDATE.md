# Workflow Update: Consolidated Plan Presentation, Complexity Management, and Pre-Planner Improvements

This document describes the changes made to implement:
1. A consolidated workflow that combines implementation plans, architecture reviews, and tests into a single presentation for user review and approval
2. Explicit user confirmation for complex tasks
3. Improved pre-planner to planner workflow with consolidated functionality and reduced redundancy

## Overview of Changes

- Combining implementation plans, architecture reviews, and tests into a consolidated plan
- Presenting this consolidated plan to the user for review
- Processing user decisions (yes, no, or modify)
- Integrating user modifications into the architecture review
- Removing the deprecated automatic switch to design workflow based on complexity
- Adding explicit user confirmation for complex tasks with ternary options
- Implementing semantic validation for logical coherence of plans
- Adding comprehensive re-validation after user modifications
- Implementing modification loop prevention for stability

## Complexity Management Workflow

### Complexity Check
- After pre-planning validation, tasks are checked for complexity using either:
  - The explicit `is_complex` flag in pre-planning output, or
  - A complexity score above the threshold (currently 7)
- For complex tasks, the user is presented with a warning and offered three options

### User Decision Options
- **Proceed anyway (yes)**: Continue with the standard pre-plan -> feature group workflow
- **Cancel and refine request (modify)**: Terminate the task; user can refine and resubmit
- **Cancel task (no)**: Terminate the task; user can start over if desired

### Benefits of Explicit Confirmation
- **Transparency**: Users are explicitly informed about task complexity
- **User Control**: Users make informed decisions about proceeding with complex tasks
- **Simplification**: Single workflow path (no automatic switch to design workflow)
- **Reduced Confusion**: Clear options for users to proceed, modify their request, or cancel

## Key Components Modified

  - Complex tasks now remain in the standard workflow with explicit user confirmation
  - Backward compatibility with the design workflow is no longer maintained

## Workflow Description

### Pre-Planning Phase
- The system analyzes the task and breaks it down into feature groups
- Task complexity is assessed and validated against threshold
- For complex tasks, user is prompted with a warning and three options:
  - Proceed anyway: Continue with the task despite complexity
  - Cancel and refine request: Terminate to allow request refinement
  - Cancel task: End the task execution completely
- Pre-planning results are presented to the user for initial approval

### Feature Group Processing
- For each feature group, a detailed architecture review is generated
- An implementation plan is created with function-level details
- Test cases are defined for various test types

### Test Critic Evaluation
- The Test Critic runs automated test quality evaluations
- Verifies test collection (syntax errors)
- Runs smoke tests to check for basic functionality
- Analyzes test coverage percentages
- Performs mutation testing to evaluate test effectiveness
- Results are added to the consolidated plan

### Semantic Validation (New)
- A dedicated validation step using the RouterAgent to make a targeted LLM call
- Reviews architecture, implementation, and tests for logical coherence
- Identifies inconsistencies, misalignments, or contradictions
- Assigns coherence and technical consistency scores
- Categorizes issues as critical or minor
- Adds validation results to the consolidated plan for user review

### Consolidated Plan Review
- All components (implementation plan, architecture review, tests, test critic results, and semantic validation) are combined into a consolidated plan
- This plan is presented to the user for review

### User Decision Handling
- If the user accepts the plan: The system generates a plan{id}.log file containing the consolidated implementation plan, architecture review, and tests, then proceeds to implementation
- If the user rejects the plan: Implementation for that feature group is canceled
- If the user requests modifications: 
  1. The system updates the architecture review with the user's comments
  2. Performs comprehensive re-validation (architecture, test coverage, test critic, and semantic)
  3. Presents re-validation results to the user
  4. Generates the plan{id}.log file with these modifications and re-validation results included
  5. Tracks modification attempts and prevents excessive modification loops

## Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: Users now review a complete picture with implementation details, architecture considerations, and tests all at once
- **Smoother Feedback Loop**: User feedback is incorporated directly into the architecture review
- **Streamlined Decision Process**: The yes/no/modify workflow provides clear options for the user
- **Better Integration**: Architecture reviews and test plans are now tightly coupled with implementation plans
- **Enhanced Traceability**: Each consolidated plan receives a unique ID for tracking and referencing
- **Reduced Race Conditions**: Sequential processing of feature groups ensures consistent user interaction
- **Automatic Documentation**: Plan files are automatically generated and stored for reference
- **Explicit Complexity Management**: Complex tasks now require explicit user confirmation instead of automatic workflow switching
- **Simplified Workflow**: Single workflow path makes the system behavior more predictable and easier to understand
- **Increased User Control**: Users can make informed decisions about proceeding with complex tasks based on complexity scores
- **Semantic Validation**: Ensures logical coherence between architecture, implementation, and test components
- **Comprehensive Re-validation**: Validates modifications to ensure they don't introduce inconsistencies
- **Modification Loop Prevention**: Prevents potentially endless modification cycles through attempt tracking

## Semantic Validation (New)

The semantic validation feature adds an additional layer of validation beyond the static checks:

### Purpose
- Validate logical coherence between architecture, implementation, and tests
- Ensure decisions are consistent across all components
- Identify misalignments between architectural decisions and implementation approaches
- Ensure test coverage aligns with architectural risk areas
- Detect logical contradictions in the overall plan

### Process
1. Extract relevant plan components (architecture, implementation, tests)
2. Create a targeted prompt for the LLM via RouterAgent
3. Analyze for logical gaps, inconsistencies, and coherence issues
4. Generate coherence and technical consistency scores (0-10)
5. Classify issues as critical or minor
6. Add validation results to the consolidated plan
7. Include warnings in the Test Critic report for user visibility

### Re-validation After Modifications
- When users modify a plan, re-run all validations:
  - Architecture-implementation validation
  - Test coverage validation
  - Test Critic evaluation
  - Semantic validation
- Present comprehensive re-validation results to the user
- Flag critical issues that might affect plan viability
- Save re-validation results in the plan file for traceability

### Modification Loop Prevention
- Track the number of modification attempts for a single plan
- Enforce a maximum limit (default: 3) on modification attempts
- Prevent excessive back-and-forth that could indicate fundamental issues
- Provide clear notification when the limit is reached
- Gracefully handle excessive modification attempts

## Test Implementation Enhancement

### Enhanced Test Implementation Generation and Validation

The test implementation generation phase has been enhanced with improved system prompts, validation, and repair capabilities:

#### Test Implementation System Prompt
- Enhanced system prompt with clear role definition, purpose, and sequential steps
- Added comprehensive JSON schema with examples for all test types

  - Traceability coverage percentage
  - Security concern coverage percentage

### Updated Planning Workflow

The overall planning workflow has been updated to ensure coherent progression from architecture review to implementation:

1. **Architecture Review**: Identify logical gaps, optimizations, and security concerns
2. **Test Specification Refinement**: Refine test requirements based on architecture review
3. **Test Implementation**: Generate complete, runnable test code for specified tests
   - *New*: Validate and repair test implementations to ensure quality
   - *New*: Calculate validation metrics to assess test quality
4. **Implementation Planning**: Create detailed implementation plan that will pass tests
5. **Semantic Validation**: Validate coherence between all planning components
   - *New*: Incorporate test implementation validation results

### Benefits of Enhanced Test Implementation
- **Higher Quality Tests**: Tests are syntactically valid and runnable
- **Improved Security**: Security concerns are properly addressed with tests

- Test structure completeness checks identify missing components

These tests ensure the reliability and correctness of the consolidated workflow, complexity management, semantic validation, and test implementation validation enhancements.

## Pre-Planner to Planner Workflow Improvements

The pre-planner to planner workflow has been improved to consolidate functionality and remove redundancy:

### Overview of Changes

- Consolidated all pre-planning functionality into `pre_planner_json_enforced.py`
- Added `regenerate_pre_planning_with_modifications` function to handle user modifications
- Updated Coordinator to use the consolidated functionality
- Removed the legacy `pre_planner.py` wrapper; tests now import `pre_planner_json_enforced.py` directly
- Removed dead code that was using the simple system prompt in planner.py

### Key Components Modified

#### pre_planner_json_enforced.py

- Added `regenerate_pre_planning_with_modifications` function to handle user modifications
- This function takes original results and modification text, combines them into a prompt
- Uses the same system prompt and validation logic as the initial planning
- Provides fallback mechanisms for maintaining backward compatibility

#### planner.py

- Removed the `create_plan` method that used a simple system prompt
- Removed the `update_plan_with_user_feedback` method that used the same simple prompt
- Removed related helper methods that were part of this legacy workflow
- Planner now uses only the extensive prompt from planner_json_enforced.py

#### pre_planner.py

This file has been removed. All functionality now resides in `pre_planner_json_enforced.py` and callers should reference that module directly.

#### coordinator.py

- Updated `_regenerate_pre_planning_with_modifications` to use regenerate_pre_planning_with_modifications
- Removed the initialization of PrePlanningManager from _initialize_specialized_components
- Added clear comments documenting that pre-planner functionality has moved

### Current Workflow Path

The pre-planner to planner workflow now follows a consistent path:

1. Initial Planning:
   - Coordinator calls `pre_planner_json_enforced.pre_planning_workflow` from pre_planner_json_enforced.py
   - Results are presented to the user for review

2. User Modification (if needed):
   - If the user chooses to modify, Coordinator calls `_regenerate_pre_planning_with_modifications`
   - This calls `regenerate_pre_planning_with_modifications` from pre_planner_json_enforced.py
   - Modified results are presented to the user again

3. Feature Group Processing:
   - Once approved, results are passed to feature_group_processor
   - Feature Group Processor calls methods that connect to planner_json_enforced.py
   - All phases consistently use the extensive system prompt

### Benefits

- **Consistency**: Both initial planning and modifications use the same validation and output format
- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Pre-planning functionality concentrated in one module
- **Clearer Code Paths**: One consistent path through the system for pre-planning
- **Backward Compatibility**: Tests continue to work using `pre_planner_json_enforced.py`
- **Improved Maintainability**: Clear documentation on what code is for compatibility only
- **Reduced Technical Debt**: Dead code identified and removed
- **Better Error Handling**: Consistent validation and repair of LLM outputs
- **Simplified Architecture**: Component roles more clearly defined

### Testing

- Updated test files maintain backward compatibility
- Tests continue to function using `pre_planner_json_enforced.py`
- Future tests should directly use pre_planner_json_enforced.py
- Regression tests confirm that the workflow functions correctly end-to-end
