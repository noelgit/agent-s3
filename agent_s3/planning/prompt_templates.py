IMPORTANT: You MUST perform the following two steps sequentially to generate the above JSON structure:

**Step 1: Architecture Review**
   Based on the provided input feature group data (which includes `system_design.code_elements` with element signatures and target files):
   - Critically review the provided `system_design` object, focusing on its overview, code_elements (their signatures, descriptions, and interactions), data_flow, and key_algorithms.
   - Be concise and direct - use bullet points where appropriate.
   - Focus on interactions between the proposed code_elements and their adherence to architectural principles (SOLID, etc.).
   - Identify security/performance implications of the proposed interfaces and high-level logic.
   - Look for missing elements within the context of the proposed design, NOT a wholesale redesign.
   - DO NOT redesign the entire architecture from scratch. Your job is to critique and improve what's provided.
   - Each identified issue (logical_gap, optimization_suggestion) must be clear, specific, and actionable, with a description, impact/benefit, and recommendation/implementation_approach.
   - List any 'additional_considerations' that are relevant.
   The output of this step will populate the `architecture_review` field in the final JSON.

**Step 2: Refined Implementation Plan and Test Implementation**
   Using the original input feature group data (specifically its `system_design` as the initial plan for each feature, `test_requirements`, and `risk_assessment`) AND the findings from your Architecture Review (Step 1):

   **TEST IMPLEMENTATION (to populate the `tests` field):**
   - Create comprehensive test implementations. These tests are based on the `test_requirements` (including `unit_tests`, `integration_tests`, `acceptance_tests`, `test_strategy` fields) and `risk_assessment` (including `critical_files`, `potential_regressions`, `required_test_characteristics` fields) from the input feature group.
   - For each unit test:
     - Populate the `tested_functions` array with strings identifying the exact function(s) covered by that test, using the format "<file_path>::<function_signature>". The file_path should match the target_file of the code_element, and the function_signature should match the signature in the code_element.
     - Populate the `target_element_ids` array with the element_ids from system_design.code_elements that this test targets. This creates a direct linkage between tests and the original blueprint.
     - Tests should reflect any signature changes recommended in your architecture review, maintaining consistency with your implementation plan.
   - Include ALL test types specified in the input `test_requirements.required_types` or implied by the `test_requirements` structure.
   - Tests MUST be complete, runnable implementations (actual code), not stubs or descriptions of tests. Ensure the generated test code is syntactically correct and logically sound.
   - Ensure all edge cases and potential regressions identified in the input `risk_assessment` are covered by specific tests.
   - Adhere to the `test_strategy` (e.g., `coverage_goal`, `ui_test_approach`) from the input.

   **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (to populate the `implementation_plan` field):**
   - For each code_element provided in the input `system_design.code_elements`, create a corresponding entry in the implementation_plan.
   - The function signature in your output should match the input signature unless your architecture_review explicitly recommended a change to it.
   - Your main task here is to generate the detailed structured steps for implementation, not to redesign the interfaces unless your review identified specific issues with them.
   - DO NOT restart the review process from Step 1. Your goal here is to detail the 'how-to' based on the code elements provided in the system_design, with adjustments only as recommended in your architecture review.
   - For each function in the `implementation_plan`:
       - The `function` field should be the full, typed signature (e.g., `def get_user_profile(
           user_id: int) -> Optional[UserProfile]:`).       - The `description` should explain its purpose.
       - The `element_id` field should be the `element_id` from `system_design.code_elements` (e.g. "login_button_impl").
       - The `steps` array should contain structured step objects:
           - `step_description`: A single, clear, actionable implementation step.
           - `pseudo_code`: Optional. A brief pseudo-code snippet if the step is complex.
           - `relevant_data_structures`: List data structures manipulated or accessed.
           - `api_calls_made`: List external or internal API calls.
           - `error_handling_notes`: Note specific error handling for each step where applicable.
       - The `edge_cases` array should list specific edge cases to handle in this function's implementation.
   - **CRITICAL:** The implementation resulting from these structured steps MUST satisfy the corresponding planned tests in the `tests` section. The use of element_id fields creates an explicit link between the test requirements, system design elements, and implementation plan steps, ensuring test congruence.

   **DISCUSSION (to populate the `discussion` field):**
   - Provide an overall summary of your approach, key decisions, and the rationale behind the plan, explaining how the architecture review influenced the final test and implementation plans.

**General Adherence to Guidelines (Apply to both steps and final output):**
*   Apply OWASP Top 10 security practices, input validation, secure credential storage, and proper session handling (for requirements and risk assessment).
*   Consider performance: time complexity, resource usage, database query efficiency, and memory management (for architectural and design decisions).
*   Follow code quality standards: SOLID principles, modularity, clear naming, error handling, and DRY (for feature decomposition and design).
*   Ensure accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA, semantic HTML, ARIA, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support (for requirements and acceptance criteria).
*   Adhere to project-specific guidelines for architecture, tech stack, error handling, UI/UX, testing, and development workflow if provided in context.
*   **The implementation plan is a direct, detailed elaboration of the input system_design.code_elements, and the tests must accurately verify these elements.**
*   **Maintain consistent element_id references throughout architecture review, implementation plan, and tests to ensure complete traceability.**
*   **The final generated implementation code derived from this plan MUST pass the tests generated within this same plan.**
