# Agent-S3

Agent-S3 is a modern AI coding agent designed to empower engineers by emphasizing transparency, control, and strict adherence to guidelines. Recognizing that AI can and will make mistakes, Agent-S3 ensures that the engineer remains in control at every stage of the development process.

## Overview

Agent-S3 automates feature planning, code generation, and execution while maintaining a step-by-step approach to prioritize correctness over convenience. Key features include:

- **Structured Persona Debates:** During feature planning, Agent-S3 facilitates structured debates among predefined personas (e.g., Business, Expert Coder, Reviewer, Validator) to expose the Chain of Thought (CoT) of the LLM. This ensures that the generated plan is well-reasoned and adheres to strict guidelines.

- **Plan Approval Workflow:** Engineers can approve, reject, or modify the final step-by-step plan generated by the LLM. This ensures that every feature aligns with project requirements and guidelines.

- **Audit Trail Creation:** Each feature request is converted into a GitHub Issue, and subsequent changes are tracked through Pull Requests (PRs). This creates a transparent audit trail for all modifications.

- **Artifact Generation:** During code generation, Agent-S3 creates artifacts to monitor the LLM's steps and status. These artifacts provide visibility into the decision-making process and ensure accountability.

- **Multi-LLM Solution:** To prevent runaway costs, Agent-S3 implements a multi-LLM strategy. The chosen LLM is only as powerful as needed for the task, balancing cost and performance. This is supported by state-of-the-art context and cache management to optimize token usage and response times.

- **Step-by-Step Execution:** Agent-S3 intentionally follows a step-by-step approach to prioritize correctness. This involves multiple LLM calls, ensuring that each phase (planning, code generation, testing, etc.) is thoroughly validated before proceeding.

- **VS Code Extension:** For a consistent user experience, Agent-S3 integrates with Visual Studio Code as its primary user interface. The extension provides real-time feedback, progress tracking, and interactive prompts, ensuring seamless interaction between the engineer and the AI.

Agent-S3 is not just a tool for automation; it is a partner in development that prioritizes transparency, correctness, and engineer control at every step.

## Coding Guidelines

Agent-S3 can apply project‑specific coding instructions you provide in a `copilot-instructions.md` file at the repository root (under `.github/` by default). During code generation and analysis, the assistant:

- Loads and respects all instructions defined in this file.
- Applies your Core Development Criteria (security, performance, code quality, accessibility) and any additional guidelines you specify.
- Ignores or safely handles any instruction that would conflict with system safety policies or cause unsafe operations.

Place your coding rules, best practices, and user stories in `copilot-instructions.md` to guide Agent-S3's output.
