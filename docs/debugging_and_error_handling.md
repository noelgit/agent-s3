# Debugging and Error Handling

## Comprehensive Debugging System with Chain of Thought Integration

Agent-S3's debugging system combines a three-tier debugging strategy with Chain of Thought (CoT) integration for more effective error resolution.

### Overview

The debugging system leverages historical reasoning, specialized error handling, and a structured approach that escalates from quick fixes to comprehensive debugging to strategic restarts when necessary.

### Key Components

#### Enhanced Scratchpad Manager
The `EnhancedScratchpadManager` provides:
- **Structured Chain of Thought Logging**
- **Session Management** with log rotation and encryption
- **CoT Extraction** utilities
- **Advanced Filtering** by role, level, section, and tags
- **Metadata Tracking** for each log entry
- **LLM Interaction Recording**

#### Debugging Manager
Implements a three-tier strategy:
1. **Generator Quick Fix** for simple issues
2. **Full Debugging** when quick fixes fail
3. **Strategic Restart** as a last resort

The manager categorizes errors and allocates token budgets for relevant context.

### Integration with Testing
- Automatically debugs test failures
- Captures test context for more effective debugging
- Provides specialized handling for assertion errors
- Works with the TestCritic to improve test quality

### Configuration
Key configuration options include:
- Max attempts per tier
- CoT storage settings
- Log rotation policies
- Error pattern matching thresholds

## Error Handling

Agent-S3 implements comprehensive error handling with pattern detection and specialized recovery strategies.

### Error Types
1. **Syntax Errors** – pattern detection and recovery suggestions
2. **Type Errors** – variable type validation and conversion
3. **Import Errors** – dependency checks and path validation
4. **Attribute Errors** – object initialization verification
5. **Name Errors** – scope analysis and typo detection
6. **Index Errors** – bounds checking and key validation
7. **Value Errors** – input validation and range checking
8. **Runtime Errors** – capturing stack traces and relevant context
9. **Memory Errors** – memory usage monitoring and cleanup suggestions
10. **Permission Errors** – file and network permission checks
11. **Assertion Errors** – integration with the testing framework
12. **Network Errors** – retry logic with backoff and connectivity checks

### Workflow
When an error occurs, the system:
1. Classifies the error type
2. Gathers relevant context and historical reasoning
3. Suggests potential fixes or automated recovery steps
4. Tracks whether the suggestion resolves the issue

### Configuration
Error handling can be tuned via:
- Token budget allocation
- Pattern retention period
- Similarity threshold for pattern matching
- Context gathering depth per error type
