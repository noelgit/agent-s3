# HTTP API Implementation for Agent-S3

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of HTTP-based communication for Agent-S3, providing a simple and reliable REST API for the VS Code extension to communicate with the backend. The implementation replaces the previous WebSocket approach with a straightforward HTTP server.

## Key Changes

### Backend Components

1. **HTTP Server**
   - Simple HTTP server with REST endpoints
   - Built using Python's standard library HTTPServer
   - Authentication and CORS support

2. **Message Bus** (Simplified)
   - Direct command processing
   - Response formatting for HTTP

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - File-based progress logging
   - HTTP endpoint for progress queries

4. **Coordinator Integration**
   - Modified to use HTTP server instead of WebSocket
   - Direct command processing integration

### Frontend Components

1. **HTTP Client**
   - Native fetch API for HTTP requests
   - Automatic fallback to CLI commands
   - Error handling and retry logic

2. **VS Code Extension**
   - Integrated HTTP client with VS Code extension API
   - Command processing through HTTP endpoints
   - Progress tracking via polling or direct CLI execution

## Communication Flow

### Command Processing
```
User Input -> VS Code Extension -> HTTP POST /command -> Backend Processing -> HTTP Response -> VS Code UI
```

### Health Checking
```
VS Code Extension -> HTTP GET /health -> {"status": "ok"} -> Connection Status
```

### Progress Updates
```
Backend -> Progress Log File -> VS Code Extension polls or reads file -> UI Updates
```

## API Endpoints

### GET /health
Returns server health status.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

### GET /help
Returns available commands.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "result": "Available commands:\n/help - Show this help\n/init - Initialize workspace\n..."
}
```

### POST /command
Processes Agent-S3 commands.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "command": "/help"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "result": "Command output here"
}
```

## File Structure

### Backend Files

1. `/agent_s3/communication/http_server.py` (New)
   - HTTP server implementation with command processing
   - CORS support and error handling

2. `/agent_s3/coordinator/__init__.py` (Modified)
   - Updated to use HTTP server instead of WebSocket
   - Simplified communication initialization

3. `/agent_s3/progress_tracker.py` (Modified)
   - Removed WebSocket dependencies
   - File-based progress tracking only

### Frontend Files

1. `/vscode/extension.ts` (Rewritten)
   - HTTP client implementation
   - Automatic CLI fallback
   - All original commands preserved

## Configuration

The system now uses HTTP configuration in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "http": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 8081
  }
}
```

## Advantages of HTTP Approach

1. **Simplicity**: Standard HTTP requests are easier to debug and monitor
2. **Reliability**: No connection state to manage or lose
3. **Fallback**: Easy fallback to CLI commands when HTTP server is unavailable
4. **Compatibility**: Works with all standard HTTP tools and proxies
5. **Security**: Standard HTTP security practices apply
6. **Performance**: Lower overhead than maintaining persistent connections

## Migration Benefits

- **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminated WebSocket connection management
- **Better Error Handling**: HTTP status codes provide clear error information
- **Easier Testing**: Standard HTTP testing tools work out of the box
- **Improved Reliability**: No connection drops or reconnection logic needed
- **Simplified Deployment**: Standard HTTP server deployment practices

This implementation provides a modern, reliable communication layer while maintaining all the functionality of the previous WebSocket-based system with improved simplicity and reliability.
