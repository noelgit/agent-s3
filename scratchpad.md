## Mock Implementations

- agent_s3/code_generator.py: Contains mock methods `_mock_code_generation` and `_generate_mock_fallback` for code generation fallback
- agent_s3/planner.py: Contains mock methods `_mock_plan_generation`, `_mock_fallback_plan_generation`, and `_mock_error_analysis` for planning fallback and error analysis
- agent_s3/tools/code_analysis_tool.py: Uses random embeddings in `_generate_embeddings` as a mock for real embedding API
- agent_s3/tools/memory_manager.py: Uses dummy embeddings in `add_context` and `get_relevant_context` as placeholders for real embedding calls

**Next Steps:**
- ~~Populate `generate_scaffold.py` templates~~ ✅ Completed
- ~~Wire CLI to use `Coordinator` instead of `AgentCore`~~ ✅ Completed 
- ~~Review and implement detailed sandboxing in terminal_executor.py~~ ✅ Completed
- ~~Complete FAISS integration in memory_manager.py~~ ✅ Verified
- ~~Implement tool definitions in tool_definitions.py~~ ✅ Completed
- ~~Fix undefined imports (e.g. `GEMINI_KEY`)~~ ✅ Resolved
- ~~Implement hierarchical summarization in memory_manager~~ ✅ Added
- ~~Review and enhance security in file_tool.py~~ ✅ Completed with robust path traversal protection, extension filtering, and size limits
- ~~Verify issue/PR creation methods in git_tool.py~~ ✅ Completed with comprehensive Git operations, caching, and rate limit management
- ~~Review interactive flow in prompt_moderator.py~~ ✅ Completed with improved interactive flow, colorized output, approval modes, and comprehensive user feedback

**Remaining Optional Tasks:**
- Review code_analysis_tool.py and fully implement linting features
- Enhance bash_tool.py with additional security measures and better command execution
- Add test coverage for newly implemented functionality
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Add user documentation on new features
