- [X] Planning: Utilizes a dedicated planning LLM (e.g., Mistral 7B Instruct) to generate a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan, considering existing code context and project guidelines.
- [X] Code Generation: Leverages a powerful code generation LLM (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro) to synthesize code changes based on the approved plan, incorporating project guidelines.
- [X] Iterative Refinement & Debugging: Analyzes generated code for errors (syntax, linting, build, test failures), refines the plan using an LLM, and regenerates code until validation passes or max iterations are reached.
- [X] User Approval & Transparency: Presents the plan and generated code changes (diffs) for user review and approval before execution. Uses `PromptModerator`.
- [X] Context Management: Employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using a FAISS vector store (`agent_s3/tools/embedding_client.py`) and hierarchical summarization (`agent_s3/tools/memory_manager.py`) to maintain relevant context within LLM token limits.
- [X] Tool Usage: Leverages a suite of tools for file I/O (`FileTool`), code analysis (`CodeAnalysisTool`), Git operations (`GitTool`), and shell command execution (`BashTool`). See `agent_s3/tools/`.
- [X] Configuration Management: Centralized configuration (`agent_s3/config.py`) for API keys, model parameters, logging levels, and other settings.
- [X] Logging & Monitoring: Comprehensive logging to `scratchpad.txt` and structured progress tracking to `progress_log.json`. Includes basic terminal progress rendering.
- [X] Error Handling: Handles errors during execution (syntax, linting, tests) to enable iterative refinement (as described in README).
- [X] Security Considerations: Implements security measures like sandboxed execution (`TerminalExecutor`), file operation restrictions (`FileTool`), secure authentication (`auth.py`), and CSP/sanitization in UI (as described in README).
- [X] Extensibility: Modular design allows for adding new tools, LLM providers, or workflow steps (implied by architecture in README).
- [X] Multi-Tier LLM Orchestration: Intelligently routes tasks to appropriate LLMs (Planner, Generator, Scaffolder) via `RouterAgent` based on `llm.json` configuration.
- [X] GitHub Authentication: Implements GitHub OAuth App flow for user authentication and organization membership verification (`agent_s3/auth.py`). Note: GitHub authentication in the VS Code extension relies on the CLI implementation rather than direct integration.
- [X] VS Code Extension Integration: Provides core functionality via a VS Code extension (`vscode/`), including commands, status bar item, and terminal integration.
- [X] Copilot-Style Chat UI: Offers a dedicated WebviewPanel chat interface (`vscode/extension.ts`) mimicking Copilot Chat for user interaction. Note: The chat implementation currently simulates agent responses rather than capturing actual outputs from the CLI.

## Improvement Opportunities
- [ ] Enhance the VS Code extension to better integrate with GitHub authentication flow directly.
- [ ] Implement real-time progress updates from the CLI to VS Code extension rather than file polling.
- [ ] Improve chat interface to capture and display actual agent responses rather than simulated ones.
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling in the VS Code extension for API key validation.
